Intentionally unclever CSV editor for OS X

(Caution: Not finished and not stable. If trying it with data you care about, **please** make a backup first!)

*Another* CSV editor? Yes. I wanted, basically, the simplest possible spreadsheet: a fast, reliable, easy way to type values into a grid and have them saved as CSV with no further transformations, and conversely to see the values in a CSV file, arranged in a grid but otherwise fully unmolested. Excel fails spectacularly on the "unmolested" test, and all other editors I've tried add too much friction when entering values to be usable for data entry.

If you want formulas or flexible cell highlighting or automatic column filling, Excel is over that way. CSVnough tries to be helpful by doing *exactly* what you ask it to and *nothing* else.
